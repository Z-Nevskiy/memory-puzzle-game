In the Memory Puzzle game, several icons are covered up by white boxes. There are two of each
icon. The player can click on two boxes to see what icon is behind them. If the icons match, then
those boxes remain uncovered. The player wins when all the boxes on the board are uncovered.
If the python interpreter is not installed on your computer, you can check the game by running the Executive file in the "dust\Memory Puzzle " folder.
